INTRODUCTION
We automate the management of LAAS-CNRS laboratory evaluations through the development of a database. We eliminate the use of various scattered media by centralizing all the necessary data in a relational database. This data can be consulted and updated on demand. Here is our report for the setup of this database
Work carried out
•	According to the relational model given of the LAAS lab, several tables were created which stored info of all the people, publications, projects and more.
•	These tables were filled with self thought practical data.
•	Queries were implemented which gave several information regarding people, articles, collaborations. 
Explanation of choices
1.	For doing the work from home, we had to choose from the plethora of online and offline SQL editors, compilers and servers, such as PopSql, codecademy, MS SQL, etc. We decided upon MS SQL because it was the closest match to the pSQL
Organization of the group and work division
We are a group of three Indian exchange students. We divided the work equally among us and kept updating it on a google doc so that we use each other’s updated code. All of us installed Microsoft SQL server on our laptops to work on the database from our homes.
•	Together, we created the database after reading the relational model of LAAS.
•	After this, we filled the tables with self-thought reasonable data based on people, countries, scientific topics, again following the same procedure.
•	We divided the queries among ourselves as follows: 
Saharsh: 1-9
Ujjwal: 10-19
Gauri: 19-29
•	We had to look up various sources on the internet to get a good feel for how the various functionalities of SQL work. It was a vigorous and enriching experience.
